## Overview

This repository contains materials related to assignments of the Software Engineering 2 course of ECE, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

>Course professor: [Andreas Symeonidis](https://people.auth.gr/symeonid/).

> Made with valuable help from the [ISSEL](https://issel.ee.auth.gr/) team.

## Cyclopt platform

Code optimization, bug fixing and statistics extraction for code quality is done using the Cyclopt tool. The tool, as well as info on the company can be found at [cyclopt.com](https://www.cyclopt.com/).

## Deliverable 1
- Utilization of existing Swagger files from the Software Engineering 1 course
- API description transformation into a real server using SwaggerHub or Swagger Editor
- Upload of generated code to a new GitHub repository
- Creation of separate branches for each team member in the GitHub repository for collaboration
- Creation of a project on the Cyclopt platform and importing the existing features of the system
- Inclusion of future tasks required for project implementation
- Task point assignment based on difficulty (1 point = 1 person-hour)
- Application of the point system to estimate task completion time
- The project follows an agile methodology
- The Cyclopt board is updated throughout the semester, with bi-weekly assessments

## Deliverable 2
- CI/CD Implementation
- Testing strategy implementation
  - Backend Testing (Unit Tests)
    - The unit tests are located in the test folder
    - Use of the c8, ava, and got libraries.
  - Frontend Testing (Acceptance Tests)
    - The acceptance tests are located in the cypress/e2e folder
    - Use of the cypress library
- Deploy to Render
- Testing Coverage
  - Unit tests must cover at least 90% of code
 
## Deliverable 3
- Evaluation of code quality using the Cyclopt platform and tools across all active branches
- We improved the following metrics:
  - Maintainability Î™ndex
  - Comment Density
- We reduced the following metrics:
  - Unused Variables
  - Security Issues
- The project quality is **A** !!
